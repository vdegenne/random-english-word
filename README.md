# random-english-word

Oxford Learner's Dictionary is really a great resource for english learners. It has clean interface, English and American pronunciation audio (as well as the IPA representation), definitions and example phrases.
But it lacks a random feature. You want to learn but you don't know where? just pop a random word.
